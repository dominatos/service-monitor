## Example configuration for service-monitor.sh
# Copy this file to /etc/service-monitor/service-monitor.conf and edit the
# variables to suit your environment. All variables are evaluated by the
# script via `source`, so regular shell syntax applies. Lines starting
# with '#' are comments.

# Telegram bot token used to send messages. Create a bot via @BotFather and
# obtain the token. Required.
TG_BOT_TOKEN="123456789:ABCDEF_ReplaceWithRealToken"

# Telegram chat ID where notifications will be sent. This can be a user ID or
# a group/channel ID. To send messages to a group or channel the bot must be
# a member. Required.
TG_CHAT_ID="-1001234567890"

# List of services to monitor when the script runs via the systemd timer.
# Specify system unit names (e.g. "sshd.service"), or prefix user units
# with "user:" (e.g. "user:plasma-ksmserver.service"). Use spaces to
# separate multiple services.
SERVICES="nginx.service ssh.service"

# User name for monitoring user services. If you specify any services with
# the "user:" prefix above, set MONITOR_USER to the corresponding user
# name (not UID). Leave unset if you are only monitoring system services.
#MONITOR_USER="username"

# Interval between repeated notifications for a service that remains in
# a non-active state (seconds). If zero or negative, reminders are
# disabled. The default in the script is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
COALESCE_SECONDS=300

# Grace period after boot during which alerts are suppressed (seconds).
# This avoids false positives while the system is starting up. Default is
# 60 seconds.
STARTUP_GRACE_SECONDS=60

# Override the hostname in messages. By default the script uses the
# system's hostname (via `hostname`). Uncomment and set this to give
# another name in notifications.
#HOSTNAME_OVERRIDE="my-server"
